    "Orientation for colleges is a first step for many students to get accustomed to their campus and peers. There is a lot of planning that goes behind a multi-day orientation such as food, events, and number of workers needed. To assist in planning an orientation at UW-Madison, our optimization problem will try to propose a schedule over a two-day weekend to maximize prospective student satisfaction, while minimizing the total number of workers needed for the orientation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We measure the cost of an event by the number of workers needed times payrate for the event. The format of the event files and the rating survey is descibed in this report. The organizer can also change the weight of the total satisfaction and the cost of the trip. By running our code, the organizer will get a schedule of the orientation including what event to do at each hour and a summary of the cost. We will analyze the tradeoffs between satisfaction of students and total cost of the orientation. This will involve changing the objective function or implementing a lambda value with the combined objective function.\n",
